an struggle with Hamiltonian neural networks!


HNN is a kind of NN that obeys the law of conservation of energy,
also, it has a special form of loss function written by the use of the Hamiltonian Equation of the system.

This research shows baseline neural network (usual MLP ) can not show conservation of energy and it will make false predictions but the hamiltonian neural network can understand physics lows (like conservation of energy)  and make corect predictions
